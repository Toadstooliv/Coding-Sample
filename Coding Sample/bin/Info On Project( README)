The Shape class:

The shape class is an abstract class that allows for the creation and comparison of different shapes.  It is flexible enough to work for all polygonal shapes
all that is required is adding a wrapper for that shape.  Currently only Quadrangle and rectangle are implemented, however to implement others would only take around 3 lines of code
which is mostly simple functions.

Included with the Shape class is a main that allows for the user to test out the functionality of the Shape class through a simple console interface.
